To-Do List

Priority
- Make availability variable a map instead of Arraylist
	- Add get/set for day
- Implement schedule sql table
- Implement scheduling Algorithm
- Create Javadocs

Non-Priority
- DAO for Employee, Availability, and Schedule
- Create a class/method to handle the shared opening of connections/preparation of statements etc.
- Implement more data validation in Availability
- Use JUnit for debugging

Java object > table init > table crud > further implementation

Schedule
- Method Given hours of operation, days in operation, jumps in schedule (How large each row is), returns sql statement
